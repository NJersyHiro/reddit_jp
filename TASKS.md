## 6. Narrative
Takeshi opens Itaita during his morning commute, checking the "Gaming" board for updates on the new RPG he's playing. The top thread has 200+ upvotes discussing hidden boss strategiesâ€”exactly what he needs. He upvotes helpful comments and bookmarks the thread. During lunch, he posts his own discovery about a secret area, choosing his regular pseudonym "RPGHunter88." By evening, his post has 50 upvotes and several grateful replies. Unlike Twitter, where his gaming tweets get buried, or 5ch where discussions turn toxic, Itaita gives him a clean, organized space where his contributions matter and build lasting value for the community.
